	In GarageGames/Torque3D, people open a new pull request for a desired feature. Typically, they will request it in another branch like "development." Each pull request is named accordingly such as bug fixes for a functionality. They discuss this with the community and close it after it had been resolved. They check to see if the build works or fails. If the build fails, they show with a check or cross. The master of the project will give guidelines of how to contribute to their project. The community can all contribute and request anything. They can also report any issues that they have discovered. The master repo will always be a stable, so to prevent failures, pull requests in the master branch is typically rejected. Most of the pull-requests are in the development branch. Versions of the game will be pushed and people can pull requests in those too.
